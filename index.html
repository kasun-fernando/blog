#### I am a Mathematician, a Math Educator, and a Data Science & Machine Learning Enthusiast. I am currently a junior visitor at the Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgi, Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Maryland under the supervision of Dmitry Dolgopyat in August 2018 and was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto until July 2021.      

#### [Here](otherfiles/KasunFernandoCV.pdf) is my complete CV and for my Linkedin profile, please follow [this link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abkfernando/). 

#### During my free time, I like to travel and do photography. Some of these photos can be found on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kasun.fernando/).
