#### I am a mathematician, math educator, and a machine learning & data science enthusiast. Currently, I am a junior visitor in Dynamical Systems at the Centro di Ricerca Matematica Ennio De Giorgi, Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in Italy. I completed my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Maryland under the supervision of [Dmitry Dolgopyat](https://www.math.umd.edu/~dolgop/) in August 2018 with a [dissertation](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/21402) on "Higher Order Asymptotics for the Central Limit Theorem and Large Deviation Principles". From August 2018 to July 2021, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto where I continued my research work in Chaotic Dynamical Systems & Markov Processes and branched out into Inferential Statistics and Machine Learning.
