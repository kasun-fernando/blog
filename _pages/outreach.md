### Youtube

In this day and age, Social media can be used for outreach activities in an extremely effective way. Since I am passionate about popularizing higher mathematics and improving mathematics education in Sri Lanka, I welcomed the opportunities to collaborate with two Sri Lankan YouTube content creators Fadil Iqbal of [IQ Labs](https://www.youtube.com/c/IQLabs) and Ashan Ariyawansa of [NC Astronomy](https://www.youtube.com/c/NCAstronomy/). The collaboration with Fadil is on-going and we plan to have casual discussions about many more advanced math topics in the future.
