Since I am part of the visible minority, through my lived experiences, I have understood the importance of role models, visibility and also, the availability of opportunities during school and further education. This is why I was involved in outreach and diversity promotion activities since the beginning of my undergraduate studies. Below, I have listed four key avenues through which I have made contributions. I plan to continue my community involvement in the future. 

### The Fields Institute & the Fields Academy

[The Fields Institute](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/) is one key organization in Canada providing support for mathematical research as well as education. Since the beginning of my postdoctoral work at the University of Toronto (UofT), I have contributed to the [Math Circles](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/seminars/math-circles) at the Fields Institute. It is an extracurricular high school mathematics club open to all school students who want to learn mathematics beyond the school curriculum. 

Currently, I am collaborating with Pamela Brittain at [The Fields Academy](https://fieldsacademy.ca/) to develop _Fields Elementary Educator Courses_ to help elementary teachers improve their math skills, and also, I am contributing to the _Ask a Mathematician program_ at the academy. The latter brings mathematicians into school classrooms virtually with the hope of inspiring school students to perceive and approach math in a different way. 

### The Outreach Office & Math+, Department of Mathematics, UofT

The Math Outreach Office at UofT is established with the goal of popularizing mathematics in Canada by providing great programs and resources for school students, parents, teachers, and the general public.  During the last four years, I was involved in outreach programmes organized by the [Math Outreach Office](http://mathplus.math.utoronto.ca/) at the UofT inclduing the Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge (COMC).      

In particular, I designed and conducted the [Canada Math Camp](http://mathplus.math.utoronto.ca/home/cmc) during the summer of 2021. It is a program organized in association with the Canadian Mathematical Society and with the invited participation of grade 8 – 10 students who performed well in the COMC. It is an intensive week of problem solving sessions along with expository talks by graduate students and research mathematicians about interesting mathematical concepts beyond problem solving. 

I was also involved in the Fall Math Club series organized by the Outreach Office. In 2021, I designed and ran the Fall Math Contest Preparation Club for school students. Further, I was a speaker at the [Mathematics Union Toronto](https://mu.math.toronto.edu/home/about-us/) seminar series to introduce research level mathematics to undergraduates, a co-trainer in the Putnam competition training sessions for undergraduates and a co-trainer for the COMC grader training sessions, all oraganized in association with the Department of Mathematics, UofT.     

### The Sri Lanka Olympiad Mathematics Foundations & the Ministry of Education, Sri Lanka

[The Sri Lanka Olympiad Mathematics Foundations](https://www.facebook.com/slmathsolympiad/)(SLOMF) is a non-profit organization initiated in 2004 by several academics with the vision of creating a culture within Sri Lanka that appreciates mathematics and produces world class mathematicians. It also works closely with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Education (MoE) to deploy programs related to mathematics education.    

From 2009 to 2014, during my undergraduate studies, I was a key facilitator at the SLOMF and at the Mathematics Branch of the MoE. I was involved in each and every aspect of the Sri Lankan Mathematical Olympiad (SLMO) from organizing it to setting the SLMO exam papers and training the Sri Lankan students for competitions. Further, I contributed to school teacher training programs organized in collaboration with the MoE. 

SLOMF and its flagship competiton SLMO have contributed substantially for popularizing mathematics among Sri Lankan school students during the last two decades, and I am happy that I was able to be a part of it as a key contributor for almost 5 years when it relied entirely on volunteers who are passionate about mathematics. 

After moving abroad, I have continued my outreach work in Sri Lanka through alternative means. In particular, I organized undergraduate minicourses in Sri Lanka, provided guidance to undergraduates in their PhD application process, and more recently, started using YouTube videos in Sinhalese to introduce mathematical ideas and their applications to a general audience in Sri Lanka.  

### Youtube

Social media is an extremely effective tool for outreach activities. Since I am passionate about popularizing higher mathematics and improving mathematics education in Sri Lanka, I welcomed the opportunities to collaborate with two Sri Lankan YouTube content creators Fadil Iqbal of [IQ Labs](https://www.youtube.com/c/IQLabs) and Ashan Ariyawansa of [NC Astronomy](https://www.youtube.com/c/NCAstronomy/). 

The collaboration with Fadil is on-going and we plan to create more videos on many more math topics in the future. The discussions are in Sinhalese (a language native to Sri Lanka) and in the form of a casual chat to make sure that they are accessible to a wider audience.
