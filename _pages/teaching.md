Apart from research, I believe in the need of disseminating mathematical knowledge to future generations. Further, the way mathematics is taught plays a significant role in determining the way students perceive it, and in turn, has far-reaching consequences to the survival and development of mathematics as a scientific discipline. 

For more than a decade I have taught mathematics in various capacities to a diverse group of students, and I am committed to being an effective and engaging teacher for students from all backgrounds. Below, I have summarized my experience related to teaching.
