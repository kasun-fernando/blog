Apart from research, I am passionate about disseminating mathematical knowledge to future generations. Since how mathematics is taught plays a significant role in determining how students perceive it, math education has far-reaching consequences to the survival and development of mathematics as a scientific discipline. This is why I have the following objectives as an educator: 
- Communicating mathematical concepts clearly along with applications,
- Nurturing creativity and mathematical talent of students,
- Creating an inclusive classroom environment for all students,
- Fostering independence and critical thinking capabilities, and 
- Motivating and guiding students to realise their goals.    

For more than a decade I have taught mathematics in various capacities to a diverse group of students, and I am committed to being an effective and engaging teacher for students from all backgrounds, and below, I have summarized my experience related to teaching.
