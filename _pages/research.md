Broadly speaking, the prime focus of my research is <b>the interplay among probability theory, dynamical systems and statistics</b>. I investigate 
- <b>statistical properties of dynamical systems and Markov processes</b>,
- <b>inferential statistics in the context of dynamical systems</b>, and 
- <b>higher order asymptotics for limit theorems</b>   
 
using spectral theory and a combination of techniques from classical probability theory, stochastic analysis, statistics and dynamical systems. Recently, I have started looking at      
- <b>applications of machine learning</b> to problems related to research topics mentioned before. 

Apart from dynamicists and probabilists, I have formed research connections with machine learning researchers and statisticians, and I am actively searching for interdisciplinary research opportunities.

Below, I briefly discuss some of my research interests thematically. The resulting publications can be found [here](https://kasun-fernando.github.io/personal-webpage/Publications/).

<summary><b>Error terms in the local and the central limit theorem for weakly dependent random variables</b></summary>     
  
(Dynamical Systems and Stochastic Processes)<br><br>In applications, the dynamically generated data available to us are always finite-time observations. Hence, one key problem is to control the error of approximation of asymptotic behaviour. When the observations are independent identically distributed (iid), a uniform asymptotic expansion called the Edgeworth Expansion is used to describe the error of normal approximation in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Since sequences of experimental observations are never iid, we introduced a general theory of Edgeworth expansions for weakly dependent (possibly unbounded) random variables.<br><br>
As a direct application of this theory, we obtain error estimates of the CLTs for a large class of hyperbolic dynamical systems and Markov chains. The hyperbolic systems that we discuss like Sinai billiards and piecewise expanding maps are natural models in many applications like billiard models in optics, acoustics and classical mechanics, and expanding maps in random number generators, biological and medical models to name a few.<br><br>
There are many unsolved problems in this direction. There are interesting examples of non-Gaussian stable laws in dynamical systems. Is it possible to describe the error terms in other stable laws? Earlier, we were able to obtain exact limit theorems for random matrix product -->
