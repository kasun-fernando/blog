Broadly speaking, the prime focus of my research is <b>the interplay among probability theory, dynamical systems and statistics</b>. I investigate 
- <b>statistical properties of dynamical systems and Markov processes</b>,
- <b>inferential statistics in the context of dynamical systems</b>, and 
- <b>higher order asymptotics for limit theorems</b>   
 
using spectral theory and a combination of techniques from classical probability theory, stochastic analysis, statistics and dynamical systems. Recently, I have started looking at      
- <b>applications of machine learning</b> to problems related to research topics mentioned before. 

Apart from dynamicists and probabilists, I have formed research connections with machine learning researchers and statisticians, and I am actively searching for interdisciplinary research opportunities.

Below, I briefly discuss some of my research interests thematically. The resulting publications can be found [here](https://kasun-fernando.github.io/personal-webpage/Publications/).

### Invariants 
When studying physical systems with many degrees of freedom, <img src="https://cosmolearning.org/images_dir/courses/618/profile-thumbnail-w300.jpg" align="right" hspace="75" vspace="20"/><br> it is impossible to keep track of the microscopic behaviour based on physical laws. Try writing equations of motion for about $10^{23}$ (about 1 mole of) gas particles and solving that system of equations!<br>      
        
The study of _Statistical Physics_ is the study of how these particle-particle interactions describe systems on a macroscopic scale. One can calculate _observable properties_ of a system either as averages over _phase orbits_ (Ergodic Theory), or as averages over an _ensemble_ of systems, each of which is a copy of the system (Thermodynamics). In either case, **invariant measures** of systems play a crucial role and showing the existence (and uniqueness) of them is a problem of importance. In fact, the **ergodic invariant measures** can be used to describe the statistics of a system completely. 

Many systems have the extra layer of difficulty of the presence of interacting components that vary on disparate timescales. _Fast-slow partially hyperbolic systems_ (on the torus) investigated by [Jacopo De Simoi](https://www.math.toronto.edu/jacopods/) and [Caralngelo Liverani](https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~liverani/) during the last decade are the simplest but theoretically non-tirival examples of that kind. There is an on-going project (with Jacopo De Simoi) about the existence of **invariant measures** and their decay of correlations for fast-slow partially hyperbolic systems with positive centre Lyapunov exponents. 

Some systems are deterministic flows with discontinuities at random times at which they make random jumps. Such _Piece-wise Deterministic Markov Processes_ have a wide range of applications to science and engineering. I am interested in studying the existence of **invariant measures** of such systems. Drawing parallels with some of my previous work, [Pratima Hebbar](https://sites.google.com/view/pratimahebbar/home) and I expect that statistical properties of switching systems can be studied.

<summary><b>Error terms in the local and the central limit theorem for weakly dependent random variables</b></summary>     
  
(Dynamical Systems and Stochastic Processes)<br><br>In applications, the dynamically generated data available to us are always finite-time observations. Hence, one key problem is to control the error of approximation of asymptotic behaviour. When the observations are independent identically distributed (iid), a uniform asymptotic expansion called the Edgeworth Expansion is used to describe the error of normal approximation in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Since sequences of experimental observations are never iid, we introduced a general theory of Edgeworth expansions for weakly dependent (possibly unbounded) random variables.<br><br>
As a direct application of this theory, we obtain error estimates of the CLTs for a large class of hyperbolic dynamical systems and Markov chains. The hyperbolic systems that we discuss like Sinai billiards and piecewise expanding maps are natural models in many applications like billiard models in optics, acoustics and classical mechanics, and expanding maps in random number generators, biological and medical models to name a few.<br><br>
There are many unsolved problems in this direction. There are interesting examples of non-Gaussian stable laws in dynamical systems. Is it possible to describe the error terms in other stable laws? Earlier, we were able to obtain exact limit theorems for random matrix product -->
