This is why I was involved in outreach and diversity promotion activities since the beginning of my undergraduate studies. Below, I have listed four key avenues through which I have made contributions. I plan to continue my community involvement in the future. . The Fields Institute &amp; the Fields Academy . The Fields Institute is one key organization in Canada providing support for mathematical research as well as education. Since the beginning of my postdoctoral work at the University of Toronto (UofT), I have contributed to the Math Circles at the Fields Institute. It is an extracurricular high school mathematics club open to all school students who want to learn mathematics beyond the school curriculum. . Currently, I am collaborating with Pamela Brittain at The Fields Academy to develop Fields Elementary Educator Courses to help elementary teachers improve their math skills, and also, I am contributing to the Ask a Mathematician program at the academy. The latter brings mathematicians into school classrooms virtually with the hope of inspiring school students to perceive and approach math in a different way. . The Outreach Office &amp; Math+, Department of Mathematics, UofT . The Math Outreach Office at UofT is established with the goal of popularizing mathematics in Canada by providing great programs and resources for school students, parents, teachers, and the general public. During the last four years, I was involved in outreach programmes organized by the Math Outreach Office at the UofT inclduing the Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge (COMC). . In particular, I designed and conducted the Canada Math Camp during the summer of 2021. It is a program organized in association with the Canadian Mathematical Society and with the invited participation of grade 8 – 10 students who performed well in the COMC. It is an intensive week of problem solving sessions along with expository talks by graduate students and research mathematicians about interesting mathematical concepts beyond problem solving. . I was also involved in the Fall Math Club series organized by the Outreach Office. In 2021, I designed and ran the Fall Math Contest Preparation Club for school students. Further, I was a speaker at the Mathematics Union Toronto seminar series to introduce research level mathematics to undergraduates, a co-trainer in the Putnam competition training sessions for undergraduates and a co-trainer for the COMC grader training sessions, all oraganized in association with the Department of Mathematics, UofT. . Youtube . Social media is an extremely effective tool for outreach activities. Since I am passionate about popularizing higher mathematics and improving mathematics education in Sri Lanka, I welcomed the opportunities to collaborate with two Sri Lankan YouTube content creators Fadil Iqbal of IQ Labs and Ashan Ariyawansa of NC Astronomy. The collaboration with Fadil is on-going and we plan to have casual discussions about many more advanced math topics in the future. . . . . The Sri Lanka Olympiad Mathematics Foundations (SLOMF) &amp; the Ministry of Education, Sri Lanka .",

An error term in the Central Limit Theorem for sums of discrete random variables. | . with Dmitry Dolgopyat, 42 pp (revisions submitted) We consider sums of independent identically distributed random variables those distributions have $d+1$ atoms. Such distributions never admit an Edgeworth expansion of order $d$ but we show that for almost all parameters the Edgeworth expansion of order $d-1$ is valid and the error of the order $d-1$ Edgeworth expansion is typically of order $n^{-d/2}$. . The Bootstrap for dynamical systems | . with Nan Zou, 69 pp (submitted) . Despite their deterministic nature, dynamical systems often exhibit seemingly random behaviour. Consequently, a dynamical system is usually represented by a probabilistic model of which the unknown parameters must be estimated using statistical methods. When measuring the uncertainty of such parameter estimation, the bootstrap stands out as a simple but powerful technique. In this paper, we develop the bootstrap for dynamical systems and establish not only its consistency but also its second-order efficiency via a novel continuous Edgeworth expansion for dynamical systems. Moreover, we verify the theoretical results about the bootstrap using computer simulations. . Robust normalizing flows using Bernstein-type polynomials. | . with Sameera Ramasinghe, 15 pp (submitted) . Normalizing flows (NFs) are a class of generative models that allows exact density evaluation and sampling. We propose a framework to construct NFs based on increasing triangular maps and Bernstein-type polynomials. Compared to the existing (universal) NF frameworks, our method provides compelling advantages like theoretical upper bounds for the approximation error, robustness, higher interpretability, suitability for compactly supported densities, and the ability to employ higher degree polynomials without training instability. Moreover, we provide a constructive universality proof, which gives analytic expressions of the approximations for known transformations. We conduct a thorough theoretical analysis and empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets. . Expansions in the Central and the Local Limit Theorems for Dynamical Systems. | . with Fran&ccedil;oise P&egrave;ne, Communications in Mathematical Physics 389, 273–347, 75 pp (2022) doi:10.1007/s00220-021-04255-z . We study higher order expansions both in the Berry-Ess&amp;een estimate (Edgeworth expansions) and in the local limit theorems for Birkhoff sums of chaotic probability preserving dynamical systems. We establish general results under technical assumptions, discuss the verification of these assumptions and illustrate our results by different examples (subshifts of finite type, Young towers, Sinai billiards, random matrix products), including situations of unbounded observables with integrability order arbitrarily close to the optimal moment condition required in the i.i.d. setting. . Edgeworth expansions for weakly dependent random variables. | . with Carlangelo Liverani , Annales de l&#39;Institut Henri Poincar&eacute;, 57(1) (2021) 469-505, 37 pp: doi:10.1214/20-AIHP1085 . We discuss sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of asymptotic expansions for the CLT for weakly dependent random variables including observations arising from sufficiently chaotic dynamical systems like piece-wise expanding maps and strongly ergodic Markov chains. We primarily use spectral techniques to obtain the results. . Higher order asymptotics for large deviations - Part II. | . with Pratima Hebbar, Stochastics and Dynamics, 21(5) (2021) 21 pp: doi:10.1142/S0219493721500258 . We obtain asymptotic expansions for the large deviation principle (LDP) for continuous time stochastic processes with weakly dependent increments. As a key example, we show that additive functionals of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) satisfying H&ouml;rmander condition on a d-dimensional compact manifold admit these asymptotic expansions of all orders. . Higher order asymptotics for large deviations - Part I. | . with Pratima Hebbar, Asymptotic Analysis, 121 (2021) 219–257, 39 pp: doi:10.3233/ASY-201602 . For sequences of non-lattice weakly dependent random variables, we obtain asymptotic expansions for Large Deviation Principles. These expansions, commonly referred to as strong large deviation results, are in the spirit of Edgeworth Expansions for the Central Limit Theorem. We apply our results to show that Diophantine iid sequences, finite state Markov chains, strongly ergodic Markov chains and Birkhoff sums of smooth expanding maps &amp; subshifts of finite type satisfy these strong large deviation results.",

          "content": "Broadly speaking, the prime focus of my research is the interplay between probability theory, dynamical systems and statistics.

Recently, I have started looking at . applications of machine learning to solve related problems. | . So far, I have collaborated with and have ongoing collaborations with a diverse group of researchers based in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Italy, and the United States. Apart from dynamicists and probabilists, I have formed research connections with statisticians and machine learning researchers, and I am actively searching for interdisciplinary research opportunities. . Below, I discuss some of my research interests grouped by major themes. I mention the motivation behind each long-term project and the collaborators I work with. The resulting publications are here. . Error terms in the local and the central limit theorem for weakly dependent random variables (Dynamical Systems and Stochastic Processes)In applications, the dynamically generated data available to us are always finite-time observations. Hence, one key problem is to control the error of approximation of asymptotic behaviour. When the observations are independent identically distributed (iid), a uniform asymptotic expansion called the Edgeworth Expansion is used to describe the error of normal approximation in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Since sequences of experimental observations are never iid, we introduced a general theory of Edgeworth expansions for weakly dependent (possibly unbounded) random variables. As a direct application of this theory, we obtain error estimates of the CLTs for a large class of hyperbolic dynamical systems and Markov chains. The hyperbolic systems that we discuss like Sinai billiards and piecewise expanding maps are natural models in many applications like billiard models in optics, acoustics and classical mechanics, and expanding maps in random number generators, biological and medical models to name a few. There are many unsolved problems in this direction. There are interesting examples of non-Gaussian stable laws in dynamical systems. Is it possible to describe the error terms in other stable laws? Earlier, we were able to obtain exact limit theorems for random matrix product",
