          "content": "Since I am part of the visible minority, through my lived experiences, I have understood the importance of role models, visibility and also, the availability of opportunities during school and further education. This is why I was involved in outreach and diversity promotion activities since the beginning of my undergraduate studies. Below, I have listed four key avenues through which I have made contributions. I plan to continue my community involvement in the future. . The Fields Institute &amp; the Fields Academy . The Fields Institute is one key organization in Canada providing support for mathematical research as well as education. Since the beginning of my postdoctoral work at the University of Toronto (UofT), I have contributed to the Math Circles at the Fields Institute. It is an extracurricular high school mathematics club open to all school students who want to learn mathematics beyond the school curriculum. . Currently, I am collaborating with Pamela Brittain at The Fields Academy to develop Fields Elementary Educator Courses to help elementary teachers improve their math skills, and also, I am contributing to the Ask a Mathematician program at the academy. The latter brings mathematicians into school classrooms virtually with the hope of inspiring school students to perceive and approach math in a different way. . The Outreach Office &amp; Math+, Department of Mathematics, UofT . The Math Outreach Office at UofT is established with the goal of popularizing mathematics in Canada by providing great programs and resources for school students, parents, teachers, and the general public. During the last four years, I was involved in outreach programmes organized by the Math Outreach Office at the UofT inclduing the Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge (COMC). . In particular, I designed and conducted the Canada Math Camp during the summer of 2021. It is a program organized in association with the Canadian Mathematical Society and with the invited participation of grade 8 – 10 students who performed well in the COMC. It is an intensive week of problem solving sessions along with expository talks by graduate students and research mathematicians about interesting mathematical concepts beyond problem solving. . I was also involved in the Fall Math Club series organized by the Outreach Office. In 2021, I designed and ran the Fall Math Contest Preparation Club for school students. Further, I was a speaker at the Mathematics Union Toronto seminar series to introduce research level mathematics to undergraduates, a co-trainer in the Putnam competition training sessions for undergraduates and a co-trainer for the COMC grader training sessions, all oraganized in association with the Department of Mathematics, UofT. . The SLOMF &amp; the Ministry of Education, Sri Lanka . The Sri Lanka Olympiad Mathematics Foundation (SLOMF) is a non-profit organization initiated in 2004 by several academics with the vision of creating a culture within Sri Lanka that appreciates mathematics and produces world class mathematicians. It also works closely with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Education (MoE) to deploy programs related to mathematics education. . From 2009 to 2014, during my undergraduate studies, I was a key facilitator at the SLOMF and at the Mathematics Branch of the MoE. I was involved in each and every aspect of the Sri Lankan Mathematical Olympiad (SLMO) from organizing it to setting the SLMO exam papers and training the Sri Lankan students for competitions. Further, I contributed to school teacher training programs organized in collaboration with the MoE. . SLOMF and its flagship competiton SLMO have contributed substantially for popularizing mathematics among Sri Lankan school students during the last two decades, and I am happy that I was able to be a part of it as a key contributor for almost 5 years when it relied entirely on volunteers who are passionate about mathematics. . After moving abroad, I have continued my outreach work in Sri Lanka through alternative means. In particular, I organized undergraduate minicourses in Sri Lanka, provided guidance to undergraduates in their PhD application process, and more recently, started using YouTube videos in Sinhalese to introduce mathematical ideas and their applications to a general audience in Sri Lanka. . Youtube . Social media is an extremely effective tool for outreach activities. Since I am passionate about popularizing higher mathematics and improving mathematics education in Sri Lanka, I welcomed the opportunities to collaborate with two Sri Lankan YouTube content creators Fadil Iqbal of IQ Labs and Ashan Ariyawansa of NC Astronomy. . The collaboration with Fadil is on-going and we plan to create more videos on many more math topics in the future. The discussions are in Sinhalese (a language native to Sri Lanka) and in the form of a casual chat to make sure that they are accessible to a wider audience. . . . .",

An error term in the Central Limit Theorem for sums of discrete random variables . with Dmitry Dolgopyat, 42 pp (revisions submitted) Abstract We consider sums of independent identically distributed random variables those distributions have $d+1$ atoms. Such distributions never admit an Edgeworth expansion of order $d$ but we show that for almost all parameters the Edgeworth expansion of order $d-1$ is valid and the error of the order $d-1$ Edgeworth expansion is typically of order $n^{-d/2}$. . . The Bootstrap for dynamical systems . with Nan Zou, 69 pp (submitted) Abstract Despite their deterministic nature, dynamical systems often exhibit seemingly random behaviour. Consequently, a dynamical system is usually represented by a probabilistic model of which the unknown parameters must be estimated using statistical methods. When measuring the uncertainty of such parameter estimation, the bootstrap stands out as a simple but powerful technique. In this paper, we develop the bootstrap for dynamical systems and establish not only its consistency but also its second-order efficiency via a novel continuous Edgeworth expansion for dynamical systems. Moreover, we verify the theoretical results about the bootstrap using computer simulations. . . Robust normalizing flows using Bernstein-type polynomials . with Sameera Ramasinghe, 15 pp (submitted) Abstract Normalizing flows (NFs) are a class of generative models that allows exact density evaluation and sampling. We propose a framework to construct NFs based on increasing triangular maps and Bernstein-type polynomials. Compared to the existing (universal) NF frameworks, our method provides compelling advantages like theoretical upper bounds for the approximation error, robustness, higher interpretability, suitability for compactly supported densities, and the ability to employ higher degree polynomials without training instability. Moreover, we provide a constructive universality proof, which gives analytic expressions of the approximations for known transformations. We conduct a thorough theoretical analysis and empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets. . . Expansions in the Central and the Local Limit Theorems for Dynamical Systems . with Fran&ccedil;oise P&egrave;ne, Communications in Mathematical Physics 389, 273–347, 75 pp (2022) doi:10.1007/s00220-021-04255-z Abstract We study higher order expansions both in the Berry-Ess&amp;een estimate (Edgeworth expansions) and in the local limit theorems for Birkhoff sums of chaotic probability preserving dynamical systems. We establish general results under technical assumptions, discuss the verification of these assumptions and illustrate our results by different examples (subshifts of finite type, Young towers, Sinai billiards, random matrix products), including situations of unbounded observables with integrability order arbitrarily close to the optimal moment condition required in the i.i.d. setting. . . Edgeworth expansions for weakly dependent random variables . with Carlangelo Liverani , Annales de l&#39;Institut Henri Poincar&eacute;, 57(1) (2021) 469-505, 37 pp: doi:10.1214/20-AIHP1085 Abstract We discuss sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of asymptotic expansions for the CLT for weakly dependent random variables including observations arising from sufficiently chaotic dynamical systems like piece-wise expanding maps and strongly ergodic Markov chains. We primarily use spectral techniques to obtain the results. . . Higher order asymptotics for large deviations - Part II . with Pratima Hebbar, Stochastics and Dynamics, 21(5) (2021) 21 pp: doi:10.1142/S0219493721500258 Abstract We obtain asymptotic expansions for the large deviation principle (LDP) for continuous time stochastic processes with weakly dependent increments. As a key example, we show that additive functionals of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) satisfying H&ouml;rmander condition on a d-dimensional compact manifold admit these asymptotic expansions of all orders. . . Higher order asymptotics for large deviations - Part I . with Pratima Hebbar, Asymptotic Analysis, 121 (2021) 219–257, 39 pp: doi:10.3233/ASY-201602 Abstract For sequences of non-lattice weakly dependent random variables, we obtain asymptotic expansions for Large Deviation Principles. These expansions, commonly referred to as strong large deviation results, are in the spirit of Edgeworth Expansions for the Central Limit Theorem. We apply our results to show that Diophantine iid sequences, finite state Markov chains, strongly ergodic Markov chains and Birkhoff sums of smooth expanding maps &amp; subshifts of finite type satisfy these strong large deviation results. . .",

          "content": "Broadly speaking, the prime focus of my research is the interplay among probability theory, dynamical systems and statistics. I investigate . statistical properties of dynamical systems and Markov processes, | inferential statistics in the context of dynamical systems, and | higher order asymptotics for limit theorems | . using spectral theory and a combination of techniques from classical probability theory, stochastic analysis, statistics and dynamical systems. Recently, I have started looking at . applications of machine learning to problems related to research topics mentioned before. | . Apart from dynamicists and probabilists, I have formed research connections with machine learning researchers and statisticians, and I am actively searching for interdisciplinary research opportunities. . Below, I briefly discuss some of my research interests thematically. The resulting publications can be found here. . Invariants . When studying physical systems with many degrees of freedom, it is impossible to keep track of the microscopic behaviour based on physical laws. Try writing equations of motion for about $10^{23}$ (about 1 mole of) gas particles and solving that system of equations! . The study of Statistical Physics is the study of how these particle-particle interactions describe systems on a macroscopic scale. One can calculate observable properties of a system either as averages over phase trajectories (Ergodic Theory), or as averages over an ensemble of systems, each of which is a copy of the system (Thermodynamics). In either case, invariant measures of systems play a crucial role and showing the existence (and uniqueness) of them is a problem of importance. In fact, the ergodic invariant measures can be used to describe the statistics of a system completely. . Many systems have the extra layer of difficulty of the presence of interacting components that vary on disparate timescales. Fast-slow partially hyperbolic systems (on the torus) investigated by Jacopo De Simoi and Caralngelo Liverani during the last decade are the simplest but theoretically non-tirival examples of this kind. I have an on-going project (with Jacopo De Simoi) about the existence of invariant measures and their decay of correlations for fast-slow partially hyperbolic systems with positive centre Lyapunov exponents. . Some systems are deterministic flows with discontinuities at random times at which they make random jumps. Such Piece-wise Deterministic Markov Processes have a wide range of applications to science and engineering. I am interested in studying the existence of invariant measures in such systems. Drawing parallels with some of my previous work, Pratima Hebbar and I expect that statistical properties of switching systems can be studied. . Asymptotics . Ergodic theory asserts that most of the realisations of an ergodic system distributes according to an ergodic invariant measure. This has far reaching consequences for practical applications that range from celestial mechanics to molecular dynamics and drug design. However, for these finite-time applications, precise asymptotics of limit laws describing the system are required. . With Dmitry Dolgopyat, I extended the existing theory of Edgeworth expansions (higher order asymptotics of the Central Limit Theorem) for iid random variables to include typical discrete random variables and provided a precise description of the failure of such expansions. Also, we introduced a general theory of Edgeworth expansions for weakly dependent (arising as observations from chaotic dynamical systems or Markov processes) possibly unbounded random variables with Françoise Pène as an extension of one of my previous projects with Caralngelo Liverani. The hyperbolic systems that we discuss like Sinai billiards and piecewise expanding maps are natural models in many applications: billiard models in optics, acoustics and classical mechanics, and expanding maps in random number generators, biological and medical models to name a few. There is an on-going project with Françoise Pène on generalizing the theory to include systems that exhibit intermittent behaviour. . . Estimates .",
