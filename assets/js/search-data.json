I investigate . statistical properties of dynamical systems and Markov processes, | inferential statistics in the context of dynamical systems, and | higher order asymptotics for limit theorems using spectral theory and a combination of techniques from classical probability theory, stochastic analysis, statistics and dynamical systems. Recently, I have started looking at | applications of machine learning to solve related problems. | . Below, I have listed some of my research interests, the motivation behind them and the collaborators I work with. If you find the problems interesting and would like to discuss, don’t hesitate to write to me. . Extension of the classical theory of Edgeworth expansions to non-lattice discrete random variables (Classical Probability Theory) | In applications, the dynamically generated data available to us are always finite-time observations. Hence, one key problem is to control the error of approximation of asymptotic behaviour. When the observations are independent identically distributed (iid), a uniform asymptotic expansion called the Edgeworth Expansion is used to describe the error of normal approximation in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The classical theory about these expansions is far from complete and does not discuss discrete random variables. As the first step, we extended the existing theory to include typical discrete random variables. . As the next few steps, we have some questions in mind. Is it possible to describe the error in the CLT when we pick a particular discrete random variable instead of describing the typical error? In particular, how do the Diophantine properties of the support of the discrete random variable affect this error? Also, in the absence of uniform error estimates, can we describe the error in weaker norms? . |",
